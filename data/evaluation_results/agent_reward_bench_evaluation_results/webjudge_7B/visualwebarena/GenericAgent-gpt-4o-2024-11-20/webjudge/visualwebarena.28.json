To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Add a comment on the most recently posted painting of a bridge with the title \"Question\" and text \"When did you acquire it?\".\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.

Reasoning: The goal is to add a comment on the most recently posted painting of a bridge. Currently, the \"Latest Listings\" section is visible, but none of the visible listings appear to be related to paintings or bridges. I need to search for relevant listings. I will use the search functionality to look for \"bridge painting.\"\n2. click('86'). Reasoning: The keyword \"bridge painting\" has been entered into the search field.
