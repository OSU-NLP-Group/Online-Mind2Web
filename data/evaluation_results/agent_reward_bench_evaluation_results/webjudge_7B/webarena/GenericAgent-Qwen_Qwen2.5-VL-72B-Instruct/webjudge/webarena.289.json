If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure.

However, this page only shows one order.

The next logical step is to go back to the customer list or order list to find this information.\n21. click('845').

Reasoning: To find the customer with the most cancellations, I need to access the customer list and review their order histories. The current page shows an order for a specific customer, but I need a broader view of all customers.

I should use the filters to narrow down the results to only canceled orders.\n28. click('1646'). Reasoning: To find the customer with the most cancellations, I need to filter the orders by the \"Canceled\" status. I have already filtered the orders by \"Canceled\" status in previous steps. Now, I need to review the list of customers with canceled orders and identify the one with the most cancellations. I will click on the \"View\" link for each customer with canceled orders to gather more details about their orders and determine the customer with the most cancellations.\n29. click('245'). Reasoning: The goal is to find the email address, name, and phone number of the customer with the most cancellations. The current page shows the details of a specific order, including the customer's name, email, and phone number. However, to determine if this customer has the most cancellations, I need to access the customer's order history or a list of all customers with their cancellation counts. The current page does not provide this information. I should navigate to the customer management section to find this information.\n\nThe 'Customers' link in the sidebar menu seems to be the appropriate place to start. Clicking on it should take me to a list of customers where I can find the customer with the most cancellations.\n30. click('252'). Reasoning: To find the customer with the most cancellations, I need to access the customer list and review their order histories. The current page shows the details of a single order. I should navigate to the \"All Customers\" section to view all customers and their order histories. This will allow me to identify the customer with the most cancellations.\n31. None. Reasoning: None", "chat_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a web navigation agent. The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Tell me the email address, name, phone number of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.

I will start by clicking on the first customer's name to view more details about their orders.\n20. click('729'). Reasoning: The goal is to find the email, name, and phone number of the customer with the most cancellations. The current page shows an order with a canceled status for a customer named \"Lily Potter\" with the email \"harrypotterfan1@gmail.com\" and phone number \"7735555555\".
