The next step is to initiate the search to find the relevant information about ticket prices.\n3. click('642'). Reasoning: To find the cost savings of getting annual passes for the family compared to buying daily tickets, we first need to determine the daily ticket prices and the annual pass prices for the Seattle Children's Museum.

We should click on this link to visit the museum's official website and look for ticket prices and membership information.\n4. click('207').

The current page provides information about daily ticket prices, but we need to navigate to the membership page to find the annual pass prices. The error from the previous action indicates a timeout, which suggests that the element with bid '642' is not available on the current page.

We are planning to visit 4 times in a year. \n\nGiven the current page is about membership, we should look for information on membership prices that can cover a family of four. The page provides different membership options with prices, but it does not directly mention the cost of daily tickets. \n\nWe need to find the link to the daily ticket prices to compare. Since the current tab is about membership, let's first identify if there's a link to daily ticket prices or if we need to navigate to a different page.\n\nLooking at the AXTree, there's a navigation section with a link to 'TICKETS' which might have the information we need about daily ticket prices.\n6. send_msg_to_user(\"I couldn't find the annual pass information on the current page.

Reasoning: To calculate the savings from buying annual passes compared to daily tickets, we first need to determine the cost of daily tickets for a family of four (2 adults, 1 kid age 5, and 1 kid age 2) and then find the cost of annual passes for the same family composition. Given the current page, we can see the prices for daily tickets: $15.00 for adults and children aged 1-17, with infants under 1 year old being free. Since one of the children is 2 years old and the other is 5, both will require a child's ticket. The total cost for a single day visit would be $15 (adult) + $15 (adult) + $15 (child 5 years old) + $15 (child 2 years old) = $60. \n\nHowever, to compare this with the annual pass, we need to find out the cost of an annual pass for our family.
