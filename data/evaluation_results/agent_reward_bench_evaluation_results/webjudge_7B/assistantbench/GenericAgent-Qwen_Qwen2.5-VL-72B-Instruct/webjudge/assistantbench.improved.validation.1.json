The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: What are hikes in Yellowstone that have been recommended by at least three different people with kids and are highly rated on TripAdvisor (an average from 4.5/5 from at least 50 reviews)?\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.
