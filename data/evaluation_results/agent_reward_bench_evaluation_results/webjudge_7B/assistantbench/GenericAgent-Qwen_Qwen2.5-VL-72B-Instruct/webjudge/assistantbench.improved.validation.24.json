Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Based on the last decade (2014-2023), what is the likelihood that it will snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago?

Calculate the likelihood of snowfall on New Year\u2019s Eve in percentage.  \n\nAction History:\n1. fill('147', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: To find the likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago over the last decade, I need to search for relevant data. The current page is the DuckDuckGo search engine, and the search bar is already focused. I should type the query into the search bar to find the information needed.\n2. click('149'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered in the search bar, and the next logical step is to execute the search to find the likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago between 2014 and 2023. The search button is visible and clickable.\n3. fill('85', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, which means the previous search attempt was unsuccessful. To proceed, I need to try the search again. The search bar is still active and ready for input, so I will attempt to re-enter the query and search again.\n4. click('87'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered correctly, but an unexpected error has occurred. The error message suggests trying the search again. I will attempt to click the search button again to see if the error resolves.\n5. fill('85', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, which means the previous search attempt did not succeed. To proceed, I need to try the search again. The search bar is still active and ready for input, so I will attempt to fill it with the query again and then click the search button.\n6. click('87'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered correctly, but an unexpected error has occurred. The error message suggests trying the search again. I will attempt to click the search button again to see if the error resolves.\n7. fill('85', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, which means the previous search attempt did not succeed. I need to try the search again to see if the issue resolves itself. The search bar is still active and ready for input.\n8. click('87'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered correctly, but an unexpected error has occurred. The error message suggests trying the search again. I will attempt to click the search button again to see if the error resolves.\n9. fill('85', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, which means the previous search attempt did not succeed. I need to try the search again to see if the issue resolves itself. The search bar is still active and ready for input, so I will attempt to fill it with the query and click the search button once more.\n10. click('87'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered correctly, but an unexpected error has occurred. The error message suggests trying the search again. Since the previous attempts to click the search button have not resolved the issue, I will try clicking the search button again to see if the error persists or if the search query is executed successfully.\n11. fill('85', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, and the search button is disabled. This suggests that the search query cannot be executed at the moment. Since the previous attempts to search have not worked, it might be necessary to try a different approach or wait for the error to resolve. However, given the constraints, the best course of action is to attempt the search again, as the error message suggests.\n12. click('87'). Reasoning: The search query has been entered multiple times, and the search button has been clicked, but an unexpected error is preventing the search from completing. The error message suggests trying again, so I will attempt to click the search button once more to see if the issue resolves.\n13. goto('https://www.google.com'). Reasoning: The current page is showing an unexpected error, and the search button is disabled. This suggests that the search query is not being processed. I need to try a different approach to get the required information. I will attempt to navigate to a different search engine or directly to a relevant website to find the answer.\n14. fill('106', 'likelihood of snow on New Year\u2019s Eve in Chicago 2014-2023').
