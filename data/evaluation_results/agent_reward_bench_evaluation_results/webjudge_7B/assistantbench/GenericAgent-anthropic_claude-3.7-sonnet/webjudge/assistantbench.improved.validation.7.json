The image shows a webpage with pricing information for the Seattle Children's Museum. It includes options for annual passes and daily tickets. The relevant details are: - Annual pass for 2 adults and 2 children: $200 - Daily ticket for 1 adult and 1 child: $30 To complete the task, we need to: 1. Calculate the cost of annual passes for the family. 2. Calculate the cost of daily tickets for 4 visits. 3. Compare the two costs to find the savings. From the image: - Annual pass cost: $200 - Daily ticket cost: $30 per visit For 4 visits, the total cost would be: 4 visits * $30/visit = $120 Savings = Cost of daily tickets for 4 visits - Annual pass cost Savings = $120 - $200 = -$80 The image provides the necessary information to calculate the savings, showing the cost of annual passes and daily tickets."}, {"type": "image_url", "image_url":
