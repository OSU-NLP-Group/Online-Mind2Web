If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points.

Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure.

Reasoning: To create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application\", I need to interact with the filter controls on the page. The focused element is the button to show/hide filter (bid='a46'), which I previously clicked to presumably show the filter options.

However, the current state of the filter condition is not specified, so I will proceed with filling the value for the condition that matches \"Name\".\n4. fill('a1204', 'Report an outage of a service or an application.'). Reasoning: To create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application\", I need to first ensure that the filter section is visible and then fill in the appropriate fields. Since the focused element is already the filter button ('a46'), my next step should be to select the \"Name\" field and then fill in \"Report Outage\". However, I notice that the current state already has the \"Name\" field selected, so I should proceed with filling in the value for \"Report Outage\" which has already been done in previous steps. The next logical step is to add another condition for the \"Short description\" field.\n5. click('a1030'). Reasoning: To create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application\", I need to interact with the filter controls on the page. The focused element is the button to show/hide filter (bid='a46'), which is already clicked as per the history of interaction. Now, I need to fill in the filter conditions. The first condition is already filled with \"Report Outage\" in the previous steps, but it seems there was an attempt to fill the same field multiple times. Since the field for \"Name\" is already filled, I should proceed to add another condition for \"Short description\". However, the current state of the filter condition is not clear from the provided history, so I will proceed with adding a new condition for \"Short description\" as it seems to be the next logical step based on the goal.\n6. click('a1030').

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement.
