The most relevant option for navigating to the Reports > View/Run page appears to be the \"All\" button with bid='79', which has already been clicked in previous steps, and the navigation menu under it. However, since the goal is to find a specific report related to incidents assigned to agents, we need to ensure we are in the correct section of the application that allows us to view or run reports.

Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement.
