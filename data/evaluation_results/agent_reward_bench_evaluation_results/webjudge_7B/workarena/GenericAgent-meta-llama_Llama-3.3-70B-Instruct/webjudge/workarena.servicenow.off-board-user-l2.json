However, since we are already in the Hardware Assets page, we can proceed with creating a filter to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". This requires interacting with the filter options on the page.\n5. fill('a1102', 'John-Teresa Jordan-Jones'). Reasoning: To accomplish the goal of offboarding user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to follow a series of steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done as indicated by the current URL and the focused element. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". Since the focused element is the filter button ('a46'), the next action should be to configure the filter to show records assigned to John-Teresa Jordan-Jones.\n6. click('a1108'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Hardware\" module of the \"Asset\" application. The goal is to offboard user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones. To do this, we need to create a filter to extract all hardware assets assigned to John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, edit the assigned to field to remove their name, and then delete their user record. The current focused element is the filter button with bid 'a46'. The previous action attempted to fill in the value \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\" into the filter field, but it failed because the element is not an input field. We need to find the correct input field to fill in the filter value.\n7. click('a1044'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to complete several steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". We have already filled in the \"Assigned to\" field with \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". Now, we need to click on the \"Run filter\" button to apply the filter.\n8. select_option('a1108', 'Assigned to'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to complete several steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". We have already filled in the value for \"Assigned to\" and clicked on the filter button. Now, we need to edit the hardware asset record by replacing the value of the field \"Assigned to\" with an empty value. To do this, we need to select the record and then click on the \"Edit\" button. However, the current focused element is the combobox for selecting the field, so we need to first select the \"Assigned to\" field and then click on the \"Edit\" button.\n9. fill('a1108', 'Assigned to'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Hardware\" module of the \"Asset\" application. The goal is to offboard user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones. To do this, we need to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". The focused element is a combobox with bid 'a1108'. The previous action attempted to select an option from this combobox, but it failed because the element is not a <select> element. We need to fill the combobox with the value \"Assigned to\" instead of selecting an option.\n10. click('a1044'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to complete several steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". We have already filled in the filter value and selected the \"Assigned to\" option. Now, we need to click on the \"Run filter\" button to apply the filter.\n11. click('a1044'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to complete several steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". We have already filled in the filter value and selected the \"Assigned to\" option. Now, we need to run the filter to get the list of hardware assets assigned to John-Teresa Jordan-Jones.\n12. click('a187'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to follow a series of steps. The first step is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, which has already been done. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\". This has also been accomplished. Now, we need to edit the hardware asset record by replacing the value of the field \"Assigned to\" with an empty value. To do this, we first need to select the record, then click on the \"Edit\" button, and finally fill in the \"Assigned to\" field with an empty value. However, since the current focused element is the search box, we should first click on the record to select it, then proceed with editing.\n13. fill('a74', 'Portfolios > Hardware Assets'). Reasoning: To offboard the user John-Teresa Jordan-Jones, we need to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application, create a filter for the list to extract all entries where \"Assigned to\" is \"John-Teresa Jordan-Jones\", edit the hardware asset record by replacing the value of the field \"Assigned to\" with an empty value, navigate to the \"Users and Groups > Users\" module of the \"System Security\" application, and delete the record with Name=John-Teresa Jordan-Jones from the Users list. Currently, we are on the \"Hardware | ServiceNow\" page. The focused element is the search box with bid 'a74'. The previous action resulted in an error because the element was outside of the viewport. We will start by filling in the search box to find the correct module.\n14. click('a46').
