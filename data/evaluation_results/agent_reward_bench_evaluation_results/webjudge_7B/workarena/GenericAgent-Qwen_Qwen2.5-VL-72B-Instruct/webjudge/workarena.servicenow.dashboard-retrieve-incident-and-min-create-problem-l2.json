The 'All' button in the navigation bar seems to be the starting point for accessing different sections of the application. Clicking on it should reveal a menu with more options, including 'Reports'.\n2. fill('242', 'Reports'). Reasoning: To achieve the goal, I need to navigate to the 'Reports' section. The current page shows a dropdown menu under 'All' which includes various options. I need to search for 'Reports' in the filter textbox to find the 'Reports > View/Run' page. The textbox is already focused, so I can directly type 'Reports' to filter the options.\n3. click('1099'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Reports > View/Run\" page.

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Compulsory training for employee in probation\n1.
