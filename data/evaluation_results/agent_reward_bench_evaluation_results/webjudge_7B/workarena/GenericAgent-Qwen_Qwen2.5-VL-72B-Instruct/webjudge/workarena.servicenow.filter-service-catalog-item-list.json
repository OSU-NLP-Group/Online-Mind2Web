Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful.

The combobox for the field selection is already focused, so I should select \"Name\" from the options.\n6. click('a1091'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to select an option from a combobox using `select_option`, but it failed because the element is not a `<select>` element.

Reasoning: The previous action attempted to click on the \"Name\" field in the filter section, but it seems the element is not visible. To proceed with creating the filter, I need to ensure the correct field is selected for filtering. The goal is to filter by \"Name\" and \"Short description\". The current focus is on the \"Name\" field, so I should ensure it is selected and then proceed to set the value for \"Report Outage\".\n16. select_option('a1823', 'Short description'). Reasoning: To create the filter as specified, I need to set the \"Name\" field to \"Report Outage\" and the \"Short description\" field to \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The current step involves selecting the \"Short description\" field in the filter section. The combobox for the \"Short description\" field is visible and ready to be selected. I will select the \"Short description\" option from the combobox to proceed with setting the filter condition.\n17. fill('a1936', 'Report an outage of a service or an application.'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to select the \"Short description\" field using `select_option`, but it resulted in an error because the element is not a `<select>` element. This suggests that the field might be an input field or a combobox that requires a different approach. Given the goal, I need to ensure that the \"Short description\" field is correctly selected and then input the value \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" \n\nSince the \"Short description\" field is already selected, the next step is to input the value into the corresponding value field.\n18. click('a1027'). Reasoning: The current state shows that the filter for \"Short description\" is set to \"Report an outage of a service or an application,\" but no matches are found. This suggests that the filter criteria are correct, but there are no entries in the list that meet both conditions. The next step should be to run the filter to confirm the results.\n19. click('a1027'). Reasoning: The previous steps involved setting up a filter with the conditions \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The filter conditions appear to be set correctly. The next logical step is to apply the filter to see the results. The \"Run filter\" button is visible and should be clicked to execute the filter.\n20. click('a1027').

The current page shows a list of catalog items, and the filter options are visible. The goal is to filter the list to show only entries where the \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and the \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The current state of the page shows the filter options, but the filter has not been applied correctly. I need to ensure the filter is applied properly by selecting the correct options and values.\n\nThe next step is to click the \"Show / hide filter\" button to ensure the filter options are visible and then apply the correct filter values.\n22. click('a1027'). Reasoning: The previous actions have set up the filter conditions for \"Name\" and \"Short description\" as required. The filter should now be applied to extract the relevant entries.

Reasoning: The goal is to create a filter for the list to extract entries where \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The current state shows that the \"Name\" filter is already set to \"Report Outage.\" The next step is to set the \"Short description\" filter to \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\"\n\nThe \"Short description\" filter is located in the grid cell with bid 'a279'. I need to click on this cell to activate it and then fill it with the desired text.\n27. fill('a279', 'Report an outage of a service or an application.'). Reasoning: The goal is to filter the list to show entries where the \"Name\" is \"Report Outage\" and the \"Short description\" is \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The current observation shows that the \"Name\" filter is already set to \"Report Outage.\" The next step is to set the \"Short description\" filter to \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The \"Short description\" search box is already focused, so I can directly input the required text.\n28. click('a279'). Reasoning: The current state of the page shows that the \"Name\" and \"Short description\" fields have been filled with the correct values: \"Report Outage\" and \"Report an outage of a service or an application.\" The next step is to apply the filter to extract the entries that match these criteria. The \"Search\" button next to the \"Short description\" field should be clicked to apply the filter.\n29. click('a73').

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure.
