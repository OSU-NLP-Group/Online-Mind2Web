To sort the hardware asset list, I need to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application. The current page does not provide the necessary options to sort the hardware list by Substate, Message us, and Cost. I should navigate back to the main dashboard or application menu to find the correct module.\n18. click('83'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard,\" and there is no visible indication of the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module. The previous steps involved navigating and searching for this module but did not successfully reach it. To proceed, I need to ensure I am in the correct module to sort the hardware asset list. I should try navigating to the \"Admin\" section again and search for the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module.\n19. click('83'). Reasoning: The previous actions have not successfully navigated to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module. The current page is still the \"Shared admin dashboard,\" and the search for \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" has not yielded any results. To proceed, I need to ensure that I am in the correct module to sort the hardware asset list. I should try clicking on the \"Admin\" button again to see if it provides a way to access the desired module.\n20. click('113'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application. The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard,\" and there is no direct indication of the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module. The previous steps involved attempts to search and navigate, but it seems we are still on the dashboard. The next logical step is to use the search functionality to find the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module.\n21. press('113', 'Enter'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module. The current page is the Shared admin dashboard, and the search bar is active with the text \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" already entered.

Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module of the \"Asset\" application. The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard,\" and there is no direct indication of the \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" module. The previous steps involved attempts to search for this module using the search bar, but it seems the navigation was not successful. The next logical step is to try navigating through the Admin menu, as it might contain the required module.\n23. click('83'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard\" and the search for \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" has not returned any results. To sort the hardware asset list, I need to navigate to the correct module. The previous steps indicate that the search for \"Portfolios > Hardware Assets\" did not lead to the desired page.

The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Sort the hardware asset list.\n \n Concretely, you need to complete the following steps:\n1.
