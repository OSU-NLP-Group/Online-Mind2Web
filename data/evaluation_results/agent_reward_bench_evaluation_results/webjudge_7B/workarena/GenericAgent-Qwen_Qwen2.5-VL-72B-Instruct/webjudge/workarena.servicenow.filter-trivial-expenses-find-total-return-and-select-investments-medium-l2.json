The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task.

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Allocate investments to maximize returns\n \n Concretely, you need to complete the following steps:\n1.

Reasoning: The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard\" in ServiceNow, which is not related to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. To achieve the goal, I need to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module. The navigation bar at the top of the page has a \"More menus\" button that might provide access to the required application. Clicking this button should reveal more options, including the \"Cost\" application.\n3. fill('113', 'Cost'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. Currently, the page is on the \"Shared admin dashboard\" and the \"More menus\" dropdown is open, showing options like \"Asset Workspace,\" \"CMDB Workspace,\" and \"Service Operations Workspace.\" None of these options seem directly related to the \"Cost\" application or \"Expense Lines\" module. I need to explore further to find the correct navigation path. The next logical step is to try searching for the \"Cost\" application or \"Expense Lines\" module using the search bar.\n4. click('736'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard\" in ServiceNow. The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application.

The results include tasks, change requests, and knowledge articles, but none of these seem to directly relate to expense lines. To proceed, I need to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module. Since the current page does not provide a direct link, I should explore the navigation options or search for a more specific term that might lead to the desired module.\n6. click('1281'). Reasoning: To achieve the goal, I need to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. The current page shows search results for \"Cost,\" but I don't see a direct link to \"Expense Lines.\" I should explore the available options in the navigation menu to find the \"Expense Lines\" module.

The previous steps seem to have navigated away from the intended application. To proceed with the goal, I need to return to the correct application and module. Since the previous actions have led to this unrelated page, I should go back to the previous page to find the correct path to the \"Expense Lines\" module.\n8. click('748'). Reasoning: The current page shows search results for \"Cost,\" but it does not directly lead to the \"Expense Lines\" module. The results include tasks, change requests, and knowledge articles, but none of these seem to directly relate to expense lines. To proceed, I need to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module. Since the current page does not provide a direct link, I should explore the navigation options or search for the \"Expense Lines\" module directly.\n\nGiven the current state, I should try to navigate back to the main dashboard or search for the \"Expense Lines\" module directly.\n9. click('113'). Reasoning: The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard\" in ServiceNow, which is not the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. To proceed with the goal, I need to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module. The previous steps indicate that I have already attempted to navigate to the \"Cost\" application but ended up on the admin dashboard. I should try to find the \"Expense Lines\" module again, possibly by using the search functionality or navigating through the application menu.\n10. click('1535'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. The current page is the \"Shared admin dashboard,\" and the search bar is active. The previous action involved searching for \"Cost,\" and the search results show \"Cost\" as an option. The next logical step is to select the \"Cost\" application from the search results to proceed towards the goal.\n11. go_back(). Reasoning: The current page shows search results for \"Cost,\" but it does not directly lead to the \"Expense Lines\" module. The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module and create a filter for entries with a specific short description. The current page does not seem to have a direct link to the \"Expense Lines\" module. I need to explore further to find the correct navigation path.\n\nSince the previous steps involved searching for \"Cost,\" it might be necessary to go back to a previous page or find a different navigation path to reach the \"Expense Lines\" module. I will try going back to the previous page to see if there is a more direct way to access the \"Expense Lines\" module.\n12. click('113'). Reasoning: The current page is the Admin Home dashboard, which does not contain the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. To proceed with the goal, I need to navigate to the \"Cost\" application and then to the \"Expense Lines\" module. The previous steps indicate that I have already attempted to search for \"Cost\" and navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module, but it seems I need to reattempt this navigation. I should use the search bar to find the \"Cost\" application and then proceed from there.\n13. click('1551'). Reasoning: The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application. The current page is the Admin Home dashboard, and the search bar is active. The previous steps involved searching for \"Cost,\" but it seems we need to refine the search or navigate further. The next logical step is to select the \"Cost\" application from the search results to proceed towards the \"Expense Lines\" module.\n14. click('83').

The goal is to navigate to the \"Expense Lines\" module and create a filter for entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#cac68a4c-9\". Since the current page does not provide a direct link to the \"Expense Lines\" module, I need to explore other navigation options. The \"Admin\" button might provide access to more modules, including \"Expense Lines\".\n15. fill('1563', 'Expense Lines'). Reasoning: To achieve the goal of navigating to the \"Expense Lines\" module of the \"Cost\" application, I need to search for it in the Admin menu. The current page shows the Admin menu is open, and I can use the filter textbox to search for \"Expense Lines.\" This will help me locate the module quickly.\n16. click('1667').
