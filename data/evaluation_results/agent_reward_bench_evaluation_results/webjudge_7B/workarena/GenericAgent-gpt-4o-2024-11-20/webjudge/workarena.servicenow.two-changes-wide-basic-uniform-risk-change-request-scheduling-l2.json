I will look for the \"Change\" module in the list.\n6. click('346'). Reasoning: The \"All\" menu is already expanded, and I can see the list of available modules. I need to locate and click on the \"Change\" module to proceed with the task.\n7. click('a47'). Reasoning: The \"All\" module button has been clicked, and the page has loaded. The next step is to create a filter for the list to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". I will locate the filter options and add the required condition.\n8. click('a508'). Reasoning: The current filter conditions are not aligned with the task requirements. I need to modify the filter to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". I will add a new condition for \"Short description\" and set the operator to \"contains\" with the value \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\".\n9. click('a979'). Reasoning: The \"Add AND condition\" button was clicked, and now I need to add a filter condition for the \"Short description\" field. I will select the \"Short description\" field from the dropdown to proceed with creating the filter.\n10. select_option('a988', 'Short description'). Reasoning: The dropdown for selecting a field is currently expanded. I need to select \"Short description\" from the list to proceed with creating the filter condition for the \"Short description\" field.\n11. click('a1101'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to use `select_option` on an element that is not a `<select>` element. The dropdown for selecting the field appears to require a click to open the list of options. I will click on the dropdown to open it and then select \"Short description\" from the list.\n12. select_option('a1084', 'contains'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to select \"Short description\" as the field for the filter condition. Now, I need to set the operator for this condition to \"contains\" to match the requirement of filtering entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\".\n13. click('a1084'). Reasoning: The previous action to select the operator \"contains\" for the filter condition failed because the dropdown appears to be disabled. I will investigate further by clicking on the dropdown to see if it becomes active or if there is another way to enable it.\n14. fill('a1087', '#SERIES-921e9a73-d'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to select the operator for the filter condition. Now, I need to fill in the value for the \"Short description\" field with the specified string \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\" to complete the filter condition.\n15. click('a505'). Reasoning: The \"Short description\" field has been selected, and the operator \"contains\" has been set. The value \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\" has been entered into the input field. Now, I need to run the filter to apply these conditions and retrieve the relevant records.\n16. scroll(0, 200). Reasoning: The filter has been applied to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". The next step is to navigate to the filtered list of change requests and begin editing their schedules. I will check if the filtered results are displayed and accessible for scheduling.\n17. scroll(0, 200). Reasoning: The filter has been applied, and the page is now displaying the results based on the condition where \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". The next step is to locate the change requests and begin editing their schedules. I will scroll down to check if the filtered results are visible.\n18. scroll(0, 200). Reasoning: The filter has been set to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". Now, I need to proceed to edit the schedule of the change requests. I will first check if the filtered results are displayed and accessible for scheduling.\n19. scroll(0, 200).

I will first check if the filtered results are displayed and accessible for scheduling.\n20. scroll(0, 200). Reasoning: The filter has been set to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". The next step is to review the filtered results and proceed to edit the schedule of the change requests. I will check if the filtered results are displayed.\n21. scroll(0, 200). Reasoning: The filter has been set to extract entries where the \"Short description\" contains \"#SERIES-921e9a73-d\". The next step is to verify the filtered results and proceed to edit the schedule of the change requests. I will scroll further to check if the filtered results are displayed.\n22. scroll(0, 200).

The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Scheduling Your Change Requests\n \n Concretely, you need to complete the following steps:\n1.
