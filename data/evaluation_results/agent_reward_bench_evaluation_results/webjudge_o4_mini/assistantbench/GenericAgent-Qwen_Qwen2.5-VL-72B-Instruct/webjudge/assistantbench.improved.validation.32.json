Reasoning: The current page is not loading correctly, as indicated by the error message \"net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR\" when trying to navigate to the Fidelity website. This suggests a network issue or a problem with the server. To proceed, I need to attempt to reload the page or try a different approach to access the required information.\n19. goto('https://www.fidelity.com'). Reasoning: The current page is not loading correctly, as indicated by the error message \"net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR\" when trying to navigate to the Fidelity website. This suggests a network issue or a problem with the server. Since the goal is to find information about a specific Fidelity mutual fund, I need to ensure that the page loads properly. I will try navigating to the Fidelity website again to see if the issue resolves itself.\n20. goto('https://www.fidelity.com'). Reasoning: The current page is not loading correctly, as indicated by the `chrome-error://chromewebdata/` URL and the error message. This suggests that the previous attempts to navigate to the Fidelity website have failed. To proceed, I need to ensure that the page loads correctly. I will try navigating to the Fidelity website again.\n21. send_msg_to_user(\"The Fidelity website is not loading due to a network error. Please check your internet connection and try again.\"). Reasoning: The current page is not loading correctly, as indicated by the error message \"net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR\" when trying to navigate to the Fidelity website. This error suggests a network issue or a problem with the server. Since the page is not loading, I cannot proceed with the task of finding the Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024. I need to try a different approach or check the network connection.\n22. None. Reasoning: None\n\nThe potentially important snapshots of the webpage in the agent's trajectory and their reasons:\n1. The screenshot displays exactly the table of Fidelity international emerging-markets equity mutual funds that carry $0 transaction fees, including their names and their 5-year performance figures (May 2019\u2013May 2024). Those 5-year percentage returns are precisely the metric you need to rank and identify which fund had the lowest increase over that period. Because it lists all the relevant funds and their 5-year returns, it provides the essential data needed to complete the task.
