To calculate the likelihood of hitting a day with a maximum temperature over 95\u00b0F in June, I need to gather historical temperature data for June from 2020 to 2023. I will navigate to the \"Averages\" or \"History\" section to find relevant data for multiple years.\n28. click('o7'). Reasoning: The current page is displaying an advertisement survey, which is blocking the view of the content. To proceed with the task, I need to close the ad to access the underlying information about Houston's June weather statistics.\n29. click('389'). Reasoning: The current page provides information about the average temperature on June 15 in Houston, Texas. The temperature rarely exceeds 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) on this day. To determine the likelihood of hitting a day with a maximum temperature over 95\u00b0F during June, I need to find historical data or statistics for the entire month of June from 2020 to 2023. I will navigate to the \"History\" section or look for relevant data for June.\n30. click('368'). Reasoning: The current page displays historical weather data for June 15, 2023, in Houston, Texas. To determine the likelihood of hitting a day with a maximum temperature over 95\u00b0F in June, I need to analyze historical temperature data for June across multiple years (2020-2023). I will navigate to the \"Averages\" or \"History\" section to access broader temperature trends for June in Houston.\n31. None.
