Thus, the provided information does not directly allow for the calculation of the desired probability.\"). Reasoning: To determine the likelihood of hitting a rainy day in Seattle during the first week of September, we need to analyze the precipitation data for September. The current page provides information on Seattle's weather in September, including the average precipitation and the number of rainy days. According to the table under the \"Rainy Weather icon Rain\" heading, Seattle receives an average of 1.6 inches (41 mm) of precipitation in September, with 8 days of rain. However, this information is for the entire month, and we are interested in the first week. Since the page does not provide daily precipitation data, we cannot directly calculate the probability of a rainy day during the first week of September. Nevertheless, we can use the given data to estimate the likelihood. Assuming the precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the month (which might not be accurate but gives us a rough estimate), we can calculate the daily average precipitation and then estimate the probability of at least 0.5mm of precipitation on any given day. The daily average precipitation would be 1.6 inches / 30 days \u2248 0.0533 inches (or 41 mm / 30 days \u2248 1.367 mm) per day. However, to find the probability of a day being rainy (at least 0.5mm of precipitation), we should look at the distribution of rainy days rather than the amount of precipitation. The page mentions that half the time, Seattle receives 0.8 to 2.1 inches (20 to 54 mm) of rainfall in September, indicating variability, but it does not provide a direct way to calculate the probability for the first week. Given the information about 8 days of rain in September, we might assume that the rain is somewhat evenly distributed, but without specific daily data, calculating the exact probability for the first week of September is challenging.
