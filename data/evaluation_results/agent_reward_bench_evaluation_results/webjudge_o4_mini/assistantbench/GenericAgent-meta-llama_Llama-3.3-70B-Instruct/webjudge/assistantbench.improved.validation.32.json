The current page provides a table with various funds, but it does not directly show the percentage increase over the specified period. However, we can use the \"Facts and codes\" option from the \"View\" dropdown to potentially find more detailed information about each fund, including historical performance data. Since the focused element is bid='72', which seems unrelated to our goal, we should first try to navigate to a section or page that allows us to filter or search for international emerging markets equity mutual funds.

However, we can use the \"View\" combobox to change the view to \"Long term\" or another relevant option that might display the needed information. Since the goal is to identify a specific type of fund (international emerging markets equity mutual fund) with a specific fee structure ($0 transaction fees), we should look for options or filters that allow us to narrow down the list to only these types of funds.

The current page provides a table with various fund options, but it does not explicitly show the transaction fees or the percentage increase over the specified period. However, we can start by selecting the \"Equity Funds\" category and then narrowing down the options to international emerging markets equity funds. Since the table does not provide direct information on transaction fees, we will have to assume that the funds listed under the \"Series F\" category have $0 transaction fees, as this is often associated with no-load or low-cost funds.

The goal is to find the Fidelity international emerging markets equity mutual fund with $0 transaction fees that had the lowest percentage increase between May 2019 to May 2024.
