The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task.

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Filter the service catalog item list.\n \n Concretely, you need to complete the following steps:\n1.

Reasoning: To accomplish the goal of filtering the service catalog item list, I need to navigate to the \"Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items\" module of the \"Service Catalog\" application.

However, to filter the list according to the given conditions (\"Name\" is \"Document Creation\" or \"Category\" is \"Services\"), I should first navigate to the correct module. The link to the \"Service Catalog\" is already clicked as per the history of interaction, so now I need to find the link to \"Catalog Definitions\" and then to \"Maintain Items\" within the \"Service Catalog\" application. Since the current page does not directly provide the link to \"Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items\", I will have to navigate through the available options in the page.\n25. click('79'). Reasoning: To filter the service catalog item list, we first need to navigate to the \"Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items\" module of the \"Service Catalog\" application. Currently, the focused element is a search box with bid 'a85'. We should use this search box to find the \"Catalog Definitions\" or \"Maintain Items\" page. However, since the current page does not provide a direct link to \"Catalog Definitions > Maintain Items\", we need to find an alternative way to navigate to this module. One possible approach is to click on the \"All\" button with bid '79' to expand the menu and look for the \"Catalog Definitions\" or \"Maintain Items\" option.\n26. click('294').
