Reasoning: None", "chat_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a web navigation agent. The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User Task: Find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania other than the ones in Pittsburgh on the map.\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.

Reasoning: To find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania, other than the ones in Pittsburgh, we first need to identify the location of these colleges on the OpenStreetMap. Since we are currently on the OpenStreetMap page with the search bar focused, our next step should be to input a relevant search query that can help us find these locations. Given that \"The Chair\" is a Netflix series, we can start by searching for colleges in Pennsylvania that are known to be filming locations for this series, excluding those in Pittsburgh.\n2. click('147'). Reasoning: The current page is OpenStreetMap, and the search query \"colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed\" has been filled in the search bar. The goal is to find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania, excluding those in Pittsburgh. Since the search query is already filled, the next step would be to submit the search query to get the results.\n3. fill('145', 'colleges in Pennsylvania'). Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page for colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed. The search results show \"No results found\". The previous action was to click the \"Go\" button to submit the search query. Since there are no results, we need to modify the search query to get relevant results. We can try to remove the phrase \"where The Chair was filmed\" from the search query to get a list of colleges in Pennsylvania, and then filter the results to find the ones where The Chair was filmed, excluding the ones in Pittsburgh.\n4. fill('145', 'colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed'). Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page for \"colleges in Pennsylvania\". The search results show \"No results found\". The previous action was to fill the search bar with \"colleges in Pennsylvania\" and click the \"Go\" button. Since the search results are empty, the next step is to modify the search query to include the keyword \"The Chair\" to find colleges where the show was filmed.\n5. fill('145', 'colleges in Pennsylvania'). Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page for \"colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed\". The search results show \"No results found\". The previous actions were attempts to search for colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed, but the results were empty. To find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania, other than the ones in Pittsburgh, I need to modify the search query to exclude Pittsburgh.

Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page for \"colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed\". The search results show \"No results found\". The previous actions were attempting to search for colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed, but the results were not found. To find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania other than the ones in Pittsburgh on the map, I need to modify the search query to exclude Pittsburgh. I will try to fill the search box with a new query that excludes Pittsburgh.\n7. click('147'). Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page for colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed, excluding those in Pittsburgh. The search query is already filled in the search bar with the value 'colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed not in Pittsburgh'. However, the search results show 'No results found'.

Reasoning: The current page is an OpenStreetMap search results page, and it shows \"No results found\" for the query \"colleges in Pennsylvania where The Chair was filmed not in Pittsburgh\". This suggests that the search query may be too specific or that there may not be any colleges in Pennsylvania (outside of Pittsburgh) where The Chair was filmed that are listed on OpenStreetMap. My previous actions have been trying to refine the search query to get relevant results. Since I've already tried various search queries, my next step should be to try a different approach, such as searching for colleges in Pennsylvania and then filtering the results to find the ones where The Chair was filmed.\n9. fill('145', 'colleges in Pennsylvania').
