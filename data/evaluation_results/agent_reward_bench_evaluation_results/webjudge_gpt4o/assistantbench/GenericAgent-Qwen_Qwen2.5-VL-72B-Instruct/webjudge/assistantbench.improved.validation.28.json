I should try searching for \"Ted Danson series multiple seasons\" and then filter the results based on ratings and availability.\n20. click('967'). Reasoning: The current page shows search results for \"Ted Danson series multiple seasons.\" The results include both movies and TV shows. To find the worst-rated series with more than one season that is available on Amazon Prime Video, I need to focus on the TV shows section.

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement.
