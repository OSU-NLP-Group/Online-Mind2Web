Since we are currently on the DuckDuckGo search engine page, we can start by searching for relevant information about monday.com's IPO and its C-suite members.\n2. click('149'). Reasoning: The current page is the DuckDuckGo search engine page, and the search bar is already filled with the query \"monday.com C-suite IPO\". The goal is to find out which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.

I will click on the link with the bid '642' to go to the press release page and see if it contains any information about the company's leadership team at the time of the IPO.\n4. click('752'). Reasoning: The current page is a press release from monday.com announcing the closing of its initial public offering. The goal is to find out which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO. However, the current page does not provide information about the C-suite members. We need to navigate to a different page that contains this information.\n5. click('2212'). Reasoning: To find out which of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO, we first need to find information about the company's IPO and its C-suite members at that time. The current page does not provide direct information about the C-suite members during the IPO. However, it mentions that monday.com became a publicly traded company on Nasdaq on June 10th, 2021. We need to find a way to access information about the company's leadership team around that time. Since the current page does not offer a direct link to this information, we should look for a section or link that could lead us to the company's history, leadership, or news archives from 2021.\n6. click('2211').

Reasoning: The current page is the \"Our Story\" page of monday.com. The goal is to find out which person in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO.

I will try to click on the \"Leadership\" or \"Team\" section if available, or look for a link that might lead to the information about the C-suite members.\n10. click('2214'). Reasoning: To find out which of the people in the monday.com C-suite did not have a C-suite position during the company's IPO, we need to gather more information about the company's leadership and history. The current page does not provide this information directly. However, we can try to find it by navigating to other pages on the website, such as the \"About us\" or \"Leadership\" page. Since the current page has a link to \"About us\" in the footer, we can try clicking on that link to see if it leads us to the desired information.\n11. click('2212').

The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task.

If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement.
