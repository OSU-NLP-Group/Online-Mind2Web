To proceed, I need to locate and interact with the form fields to input the origin (Rio de Janeiro), destination (NYC), package type (envelope), and delivery time (1 week). I will look for visible input fields or buttons to start the process.\n6. click('71'). Reasoning: The \"Shipping\" menu has been expanded, revealing several options. To calculate shipping rates, I should click on the \"Shipping Rates & Delivery Times\" option, as it is the most relevant to the task.\n7. click('688'). Reasoning: The current page is asking to choose a location. Since the goal is to calculate shipping rates from Rio de Janeiro to NYC, I need to select the appropriate country or region. I will click on \"Search for another country/territory\" to locate Brazil as the sender's country.\n8. click('54'). Reasoning: The current page is the FedEx Global Home location selection page. To proceed, I need to select the appropriate location to access shipping information. I will look for a visible element that allows me to select Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) as the sender's location.\n9. click('156'). Reasoning: The current page is the FedEx location selection page.

I will attempt to reload the page to ensure all elements are properly loaded and then retry interacting with the necessary element.\n12. click('269'). Reasoning: The \"TARIFAS E TEMPOS\" (Rates and Times) tab appears to be the most relevant option for finding shipping costs and delivery times. I will click on the \"TARIFAS E TEMPOS\" button to proceed.\n13. noop(wait_ms=2000). Reasoning: The previous action clicked on the \"Get Rate and Shipping Details\" button. This should lead to a page or form where I can input details about the shipment to get pricing information. I will wait for the page to load and check for any visible form or input fields to proceed.\n14. click('60'). Reasoning: The previous action attempted to click on the \"Get Rate and Shipping Details\" tab, but it seems no visible change occurred.
