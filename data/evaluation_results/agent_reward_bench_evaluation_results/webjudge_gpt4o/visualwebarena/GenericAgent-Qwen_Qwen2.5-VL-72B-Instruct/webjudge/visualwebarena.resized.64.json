If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement.
