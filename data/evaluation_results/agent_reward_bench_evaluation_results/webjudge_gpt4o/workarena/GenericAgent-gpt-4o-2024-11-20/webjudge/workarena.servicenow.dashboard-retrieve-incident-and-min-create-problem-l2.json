The report shows the number of 'incidents' assigned to an 'agent'.\n\n3. Find the agents with a number of incidents assigned less than or equal to the lowest of the number of assigned incidents across agents. For example, if you were asked to find the 'mean' or 'average' for a case where there are 4 agents assigned 1,2,3,2 incidents respectively, the mean would be 2. The list of agents required for solving the following task would be all the agents that have less than or equal to 2 assigned incidents.\n\n4. Navigate to All > Problems. \n\n5. You have to create new 'problems' from this page for all the agents based on the above criteria. Only fill the following fields when creating a new problem:- Impact: '1 - High', Urgency: '1 - High', Problem statement: 'Compulsory training for employee in probation' and 'assign' them to each agent.\n\nNote that you will create as many problems as there are agents matching the above criteria.\nFor example, consider the above case and say you have 3 agents with less than or equal to 2 incidents assigned to them in the chart.
