Navigate to the Reports > View/Run page. \n\n2. Given the title of the report, search for it on this page. The report shows the number of 'incidents' assigned to an 'agent'.\n\n3. Find the agents with a number of incidents assigned greater than or equal to the maximum of the number of assigned incidents across agents. For example, if you were asked to find the 'mean' or 'average' for a case where there are 4 agents assigned 1,2,3,2 incidents respectively, the mean would be 2. The list of agents required for solving the following task would be all the agents that have greater than or equal to 2 assigned incidents.\n\n4. Navigate to Open Records > Items. \n\n5. You have to create new 'item requests' from this page for all the agents based on the above criteria. Only fill the following fields when creating a new item request:- Item: Pixel 4a, Quantity: 1 and 'request' them for each agent using the 'Requested For' field.\n\nImportantly, you should override the default request item numbers in the form and instead use one request item number from the following list for each item request you create: RITM5062026.\nNote that you will create as many item requests as there are agents matching the above criteria.\nFor example, consider the above case and say you have 3 agents with greater than or equal to 2 incidents assigned to them in the chart. You will be creating '3' item requests here, one for each agent. \n\n","agent":"GenericAgent-meta-llama_Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct","judge":"webjudge","judge_model_name":"gpt-4o-2024-11-20","provider":"openai","judge_args":{"use_screenshot":true,"use_axtree":false,"invert_sys_prompt":false},"completion_args":{"max_completion_tokens":1024,"temperature":0.0,"seed":0},"response":{"id":"chatcmpl-BNpmHqklm2nuq18hpeXW1USm96NLh","choices":[{"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,"logprobs":null,"message":{"content":"Thoughts: The agent's action history shows repeated attempts to navigate to the \"Reports > View/Run\" page but fails to make progress.
