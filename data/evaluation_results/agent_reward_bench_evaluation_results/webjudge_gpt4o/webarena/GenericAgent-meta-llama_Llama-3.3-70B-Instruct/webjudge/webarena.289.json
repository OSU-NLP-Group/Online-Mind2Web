If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n","input_text":"User Task: Tell me the email address, name, phone number of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.

Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the \"Customers\" section and then find a way to view the cancellation history of each customer.

We need to click on the \"All Customers\" link under the \"Customers\" menu to view the list of customers.\n3. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the customer's order history. However, the current page does not provide direct information about cancellations. We need to navigate to a page where we can view the order history of each customer. Since we are on the \"Customers / Customers / Magento Admin\" page, we should look for a link or button that allows us to view customer details or order history. The AXTree shows a table with customer information but does not directly provide cancellation history. We need to find a way to access more detailed information about each customer's orders.\n4. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders. The current page is on the customers' list, and we see various menu options at the top, including 'SALES'. We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n5. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to navigate to the sales section where order information, including cancellations, is typically found. The current page is on the customers' list, and we see a navigation menu at the top with various options like 'DASHBOARD', 'SALES', 'CATALOG', etc. Since we are interested in sales data, specifically cancellations, clicking on the 'SALES' option seems like the logical next step. This should take us to a page where we can find information about orders, including any cancellations, and potentially identify the customer with the most cancellations.\n6. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders.

We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n7. click('183').

The current focused element is the 'SALES' link with bid '183', which we have already clicked in previous steps. However, to proceed, we need to navigate to a section where we can view or manage orders, such as the \"Orders\" page under the sales section.

However, to proceed, we need to navigate to a section where we can view or manage orders, such as the \"Orders\" section under \"SALES\".

The current page is on the customers' list, and there's a menu bar at the top with various options including 'SALES'. We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n11. click('234'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the sales section of the Magento Admin Panel, as cancellations are typically related to orders. The focused element is currently the 'SALES' link with bid '183', which we've clicked multiple times without changing the focused element or achieving our goal. This suggests we might need to explore other parts of the interface to find relevant information about customer cancellations. However, since our goal involves customer data and their order history, we should look for a section that combines customer information with their order history, such as a customer dashboard or order management section. Given the current state, clicking on 'CUSTOMERS' might provide a list of customers or a way to access their individual profiles, where we could potentially find information on cancellations or orders.\n12. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the sales section of the Magento Admin Panel, as cancellations are typically related to orders.

None. Reasoning: None","chat_messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a web navigation agent. The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.\n\nYour response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!\n*Important Evaluation Criteria*:\n1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), it should be considered a failure.\n2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as \"best,\" \"highest,\" \"cheapest,\" \"latest,\" \"most recent,\" \"lowest,\" \"closest,\" \"highest-rated,\" \"largest,\" and \"newest\" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).\n3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!\n4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.\n5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful. Repeat actions or actions that do not lead to a visible result should be considered a failure.\n6: If the agent loops through a sequence of actions that do not make progress toward the goal (including failing to click \"Save\" or \"Submit,\" etc.), it should be considered a failure.\n\nFormat your response into two lines as shown below:\nThoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process should base on double-checking each key points and the evaluation criteria>\nStatus: \"success\" or \"failure\"\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"User Task: Tell me the email address, name, phone number of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history\n\n\nKey Points: \n1.

Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the \"Customers\" section. Currently, we are on the dashboard page, and there's a link to \"CUSTOMERS\" in the navigation menu. We can click on this link to proceed.\n2. click('214'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the \"Customers\" section and then find a way to view the cancellation history of each customer. Currently, the \"Customers\" tab is focused, but we are on the dashboard page. We need to click on the \"All Customers\" link under the \"Customers\" menu to view the list of customers.\n3. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the customer's order history. However, the current page does not provide direct information about cancellations. We need to navigate to a page where we can view the order history of each customer. Since we are on the \"Customers / Customers / Magento Admin\" page, we should look for a link or button that allows us to view customer details or order history. The AXTree shows a table with customer information but does not directly provide cancellation history. We need to find a way to access more detailed information about each customer's orders.\n4. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders. The current page is on the customers' list, and we see various menu options at the top, including 'SALES'. We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n5. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to navigate to the sales section where order information, including cancellations, is typically found. The current page is on the customers' list, and we see a navigation menu at the top with various options like 'DASHBOARD', 'SALES', 'CATALOG', etc. Since we are interested in sales data, specifically cancellations, clicking on the 'SALES' option seems like the logical next step. This should take us to a page where we can find information about orders, including any cancellations, and potentially identify the customer with the most cancellations.\n6. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders. The current page is on the customers' list, and we see various menu options at the top, including 'SALES'. We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n7. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to access the sales section of the Magento Admin Panel, as cancellations are typically related to orders. The current focused element is the 'SALES' link with bid '183', which we have already clicked in previous steps. However, to proceed, we need to navigate to a section where we can view or manage orders, such as the \"Orders\" page under the sales section. Since the provided AXTree does not directly show an \"Orders\" link, we should look for a way to access it, possibly by clicking on the 'SALES' link again or exploring other links that might lead us to order management.\n8. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in the history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders.

However, to proceed, we need to navigate to a section where we can view or manage orders, such as the \"Orders\" section under \"SALES\". Since the current focused element is the \"SALES\" link, our next step should be to click on it to expand or enter the sales section, hoping to find an option related to orders or cancellations.\n10. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to navigate to the orders or sales section, as cancellations are typically tracked in relation to orders. The current page is on the customers' list, and there's a menu bar at the top with various options including 'SALES'. We should click on 'SALES' to proceed towards finding order-related information.\n11. click('234'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the sales section of the Magento Admin Panel, as cancellations are typically related to orders. The focused element is currently the 'SALES' link with bid '183', which we've clicked multiple times without changing the focused element or achieving our goal. This suggests we might need to explore other parts of the interface to find relevant information about customer cancellations. However, since our goal involves customer data and their order history, we should look for a section that combines customer information with their order history, such as a customer dashboard or order management section. Given the current state, clicking on 'CUSTOMERS' might provide a list of customers or a way to access their individual profiles, where we could potentially find information on cancellations or orders.\n12. click('183'). Reasoning: To find the customer who has the most cancellations in history, we first need to access the sales section of the Magento Admin Panel, as cancellations are typically related to orders.
